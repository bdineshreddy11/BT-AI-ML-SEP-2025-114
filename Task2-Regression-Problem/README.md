## 6 Installation and Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.8+**
* **Node.js & npm**

### Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal.
2.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # For PowerShell
    ```
3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Train the models and generate the visualization reports (run this only once):
    ```bash
    python train_and_save_model.py
    ```
5.  Start the Flask API server:
    ```bash
    $env:FLASK_APP="src/app.py"
    flask run
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1.  Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2.  Install the required Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 7 Usage Examples
* **Input**: On the **Prediction** page, enter key features of a house, such as `2000` for Gross Living Area and `8` for Overall Quality.
* **Output**: The application will display a predicted price from the best-performing model.
* **Visualizations**: After a prediction, a **"Show Visualizations"** button appears, leading to a dynamic display of key charts that help you understand the model's insights.

## 9 Model Performance and Training Results
The following output from the `train_and_save_model.py` script demonstrates the model evaluation process using K-Fold Cross-Validation. The model with the lowest Mean RMSE was selected as the final predictive model.
That's a great idea. Including the actual output from your model training script provides concrete evidence of your work and is a very professional way to document your project. It clearly demonstrates that you performed a robust model evaluation.

I will update your README.md file to include a new section that explains and displays the results of your training process.

Updated README.md
I've added a new section, "Model Performance and Training Results," which explains the key metrics and displays the output from your script.
